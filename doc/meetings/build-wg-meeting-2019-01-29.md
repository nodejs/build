### nodejs/build

* Add more aix machines [#1623](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1623)
  * Additional machine, but George is working on getting it installed, challenge with instructions
  * Have had better success with 7.1
  * George outlined progress so far
  * Refack, graph that shows when backlogs occur.
  * AIX is faster than Windows but we have more Windows workers than AIX
  * Talked about a few options

* Request for elevated permissions [#1337](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1337)
  * Rod just commenting on issue for GCP for prototyping new website
  * Good opportunity to make that separate. 
  * Rod still has action to itemize the items that can be pulled apart.
  * Only incident in last few months. Benchmark machine was down was hard to get awareness. 
    From that perspective it’s good because it has not been a big problem.

* Add Google-Cloud-Build to github marketplace for Node.js org [#298](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/298)
  * Need to clarify if this is for *.dev only or something else
  

* Use Foundation resources to support build [#1154](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1154)
  * Skipped because we ran out of time

*  Refael brought up issue of newer compilers for 7.3
  * Discussion was around whether this can target 12.x or 13.x
  * Either way we need to start making some progress.
