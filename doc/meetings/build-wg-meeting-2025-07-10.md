### nodejs/build

* [NEXT-SECURITY-RELEASE] Heads up on upcoming Node.js security release 2025/07/15 [#4102](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/4102)
  * There is an issue open in the build repo. Will lock the public jenkins tomorrow.
* Read Access to Cloudflare Workers [#4096](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/4096)
  * flakey5 requesting access to Cloudflare Workers.
* Machines at OSUOSL at risk [#4073](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/4073)
  * The funding issue is resolved for now. Still an issue with where the machine will reside. All the machines in the current location need to be moved somewhere else. How much down time are we going to have? Hopefully we get a call from Arm to discuss this more.
* Require Physical 2fa for Build WG & Web Infra members [#4063](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/4063)
  * There is no way to require it. It can affect the entire org which may or may not be an issue.
* Potentially transition to 1password for secrets management [#4039](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/4039)
  * The main issue we suffer from is lack of secret rotation. We should change this issue and make it specific about secret rotation.
* Replace Works on Arm machines affected by Equinix Metal sunset (June 2026) [#3975](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/3975)
  * Got covered by 4073.
* Infrastructure for Orka (2024 and beyond) [#3686](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/3686)  
* Extend Azure credits (Long term) [#3672](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/3672)
  * We got a notification on the Azure account saying we are reaching the limit.

### nodejs/node

* Enabling Rust support for Temporal [#58730](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/58730)
