### nodejs/build

* modern macOS X (10.13, 14, 15) on MacStadium [#1732](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1732)
  * @ashcripps has been trying out Orka, looking positive
  * Had some difficulties with the demo, but we received a new token, and they are trying to get us sufficient access. Looks promising.

* provision mac minis at nearform as osx machines in jenkins CI [#1695](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1695)
  * @ashcripps is emailing nearform weekly, and they are emailing their provider weekly, and nothing has happened at the provider, and we are still blocked.

* Platform requirements for Node.js 14 [#2168](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2168)
  * We need to make decisions on what we want to support
  * Then we need to get a 14.x TODO list together
  * Release candidate branches might get made in March, so time is creeping up on us.
