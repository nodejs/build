#
# Updates Windows username, password and connection ports
#
# Usage:
#
# Set the following variables with the new values in the secret inventory file:
# - new_user     - to change the username
# - new_password - to change the password
# - new_port     - to change the WinRM connection port (default: 5986)
# - new_rdp_port - to change the RDP connection port (default: 3389)
#
# Changing username, password or WinRM port makes Ansible unable to connect,
# failing the command immediately. Thus, after EACH STEP in this script
# runs/fails successfully, remove the old variable and 'new_' from the new one
# in the inventory file and run again if there are more to change.
#
# Only the RDP port needs a reboot to apply (ansible HOST -m win_reboot).
#
# Changing credentials on release machines breaks access to the code signing
# certificate, so it need to be re-installed after running this.
