# Node.js Build Working Group

Chat with us on [Slack][1].

## Purpose

The Node.js Build Working Group maintains and controls infrastructure used for
continuous integration (CI), releases, benchmarks, web hosting
(of [nodejs.org][node] and other Node.js web properties) and more.

Our mission is to provide Node.js Project and libuv with solid computing
infrastructure in order to improve the quality of the software itself by
targeting correctness, speed and compatibility and to ensure streamlined
delivery of binaries and source code to end-users.

This repository contains information used to set up and maintain the various
pieces of Node.js Project infrastructure managed by the Build Working Group.
It is intended to be open and transparent, if you see any relevant information
missing please open an issue. If you are interested in joining, please read
[GOVERNANCE.md][] to understand the process and reasoning we use for granting access
to the resources we manage.

## Infrastructure Providers

The Node.js Project is proud to receive contributions from many companies,
both in the form of monetary contributions in exchange for membership or
in-kind contributions for required resources. The Build Working Group
collaborates with the following companies who contribute various kinds of
cloud and physical hardware to the Node.js project.


### Tier-1 Providers

The Node.js Project's tier-1 infrastructure providers contribute the largest
share of infrastructure to the Node.js project. Without these companies,
the project would not be able to provide the quality, speed and availability of
test coverage that it does today.

![Tier 1 Infrastructure Providers](./static-assets/tier-1-providers.png)

- **[DigitalOcean][2]**: a popular cloud hosting service, provides a
  significant amount of the resources required to run the Node.js project
  including key CI infrastructure/servers required to host [nodejs.org][node].

- **[Rackspace][3]**: a popular managed cloud company, provides significant
  resources used to power much of the Node.js project's CI system, including
  key Windows compilation servers, along with additional services such as
  [Mailgun][5] for some [nodejs.org and iojs.org email][6] services.


### Tier-2 Providers

The Node.js Project's tier-2 infrastructure providers fill essential gaps
in architecture and operating system variations and shoulder some of the burden
from the tier-1 providers, contributing to availability
and speed in our CI system.

![Tier 2 Infrastructure Providers](./static-assets/tier-2-providers.png)

- **[Microsoft][7]**: Provides Windows-related test infrastructure
  on [Azure][8] for the Node.js CI system.

- **[Joyent][9]**: A private cloud infrastructure company, provides SmartOS
  and other test/build resources for the Node.js CI system, resources for
  backup of our critical infrastructure, redundancy for nodejs.org and or
  [unencrypted.nodejs.org](http://unencrypted.nodejs.org) mirror.

- **[IBM][10]**:
  - [IBM Cloud][11] provides hardware for testing and benchmarking for the
    Node.js project's CI system.
  - Via the [Oregon State University Open Source Lab][12], provides
    PPC-based test and build infrastructure.
  - Via the [IBM LinuxOne(TM) Community Cloud][13], provides linuxOne
    based test and build infrastructure.

- **[Scaleway][15]**: Scalable cloud platform designed for developers &
  growing companies, contributes key ARMv7 hardware for test and release
  builds for the Node.js CI system.

- **[Cloudflare][16]**: CDN and internet traffic management
  provider, are responsible for providing fast and always-available
  access to [nodejs.org][node].

- **[ARM][17]**: Semiconductor intellectual property supplier, have donated
  ARMv8 / ARM64 hardware used by the Node.js CI system for build and testing
  Node.js.

- **[Intel][22]**: "The world leader in silicon innovation," contributes
  hardware used for benchmarking in the Node.js project's CI system to advance
  and accelerate Node.js performance.

- **[MacStadium][23]**: Managed hosting provider for Mac. Provides Mac
  hardware used for testing in the Node.js project's CI system.

- **[Packet][24]**: Bare metal cloud for developers. Through their
  [Works on Arm](https://www.worksonarm.com/), Packet provides ARM64 build
  infrastructure and additional resources for powering our CI system.

### Community Donations

From time to time, the Node.js Build Working group calls for, and receives
donations of hardware in order to expand the breadth of the build and test
infrastructure it maintains.

If you would like to donate hardware to the Node.js Project, please reach
out to the Build Working Group, via the [#nodejs-build channel on the OpenJS Foundation Slack
instance][1] or contact [Rod Vagg](mailto:rod@vagg.org) directly. The Build
Working Group reserves the right to choose what hardware is actively used
and how it is used, donating hardware does not guarantee its use within the
testing infrastructure as there are many other factors that must be
considered.  Some donated hardware, while not used actively in the CI
infrastructure, is used from time to time for R&D purposes by the project.


## CI Software

Build and test orchestration is performed by [Jenkins][21].

- A summary of build and test jobs can be found at: <https://ci.nodejs.org>
- A listing of connected servers for testing, building and benchmarking
  can be found at: <https://ci.nodejs.org/computer/>
- Monitoring with Grafana: <https://grafana.nodejs.org/>

The Build WG will keep build configuration required for a release line for 6
months after the release goes End-of-Life, in case further build or test runs
are required. After that the configuration will be removed.
